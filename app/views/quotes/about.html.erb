	<h1> About Splurty</h1>
	<p>
		Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mkwaters">Mikaila Waters</a>, a designer, developer, and entrepreneur who was looking for a place to store all her friends' and her own great (and maybe not so great) ideas for companies.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're interested in setting up a startup but are not sure what you're passionate about, begin by saying "yes". Yes to ideas, yes to risk, and yes to work. Your foundational idea might be crazy, but keep pushing and molding it until you hit on something you just can't stop thinking about. When you've got something that you just can't - not work on, you should build it.
